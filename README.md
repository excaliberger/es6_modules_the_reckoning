```

i. Create a car.js file, then do the following:
    - Create a class called Car
    - Add a constructor that takes a make, model, and year
    - Create an info() function that displays the carâ€™s info to the document
ii. Create a wishlist.js file
    - Create a class WishList
    - At minimum, the WishList class should have a method for adding or removing cars from the WishList
    - Our users should be able to view the cars in the WishList from the document, so either as a method on the 
    - WishList class, or a separate function in the index.js file, you should account for this functionality of     displaying and updating the DOM
iii. Inside of index.js
    Import our Car and WishList modules
    Create a new instance of our WishList
    Users should be able to interact with our web page (DOM) to add new Car instances to their Wish List
